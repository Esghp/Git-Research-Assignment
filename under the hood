## What Happens Under the Hood When You Fork or Clone?

When you fork a repository on GitHub, GitHub creates a new copy of the repository
under your own account. This new repository has its own URL and ownership,
but it keeps a connection to the original repository.

In the background, the original repository is considered the upstream repository,
while your fork is your own separate project. Any changes you make in your fork
do not affect the original repository unless you open a Pull Request.

When you clone a repository, Git creates a local copy of the remote repository
on your computer. It downloads all files, commits, branches, and history.
The remote repository is automatically named "origin" in your local Git config.

So in short, forking creates a copy on GitHub, while cloning creates a copy on
your local machine. Both actions keep the full commit history of the project.
